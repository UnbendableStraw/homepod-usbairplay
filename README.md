# USB Airplay for A1639 Apple HomePods

First-generation Apple HomePods have Airplay capability over USB. This is still Airplay, with all it's pros / cons, just over USB. 

Observations so far:
* Only seems to work on Macs
* Only seems to work if the HomePod is already set-up. Does not work on a HomePod in Setup Mode
* Does not seem to work if the HomePod was configured as a Default Output for an Apple TV
* Can play to multiple HomePods via USB (plus other Airplay 2 speakers)(using "Airfoil" by Rogue Amoeba)
* Stereo pairs (i.e. playing to a stereo pair pod via USB does not transmit to it's paired pod. Can still use Airfoil for multiple)


To use, you need to make or buy a USB adapter for your pod. Most adapters stick out the bottom, so you need to raise the base of the pod to prevent damage to the adapter or debug port when placing it upright. I have 3d printable adapters and stands you can make or buy here: https://github.com/UnbendableStraw/homepwn-simple/
